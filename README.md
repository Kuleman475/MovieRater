# Overview

The software I wrote is a database for movies I have watched and rated them on what stars I would give them I also made it where you could add and edit and delete data from the database as well as make it so you could see your entire database. 

The purpose for writing this program is to make it to be able to learn sqlite and to be able to use python to write the program. I have used mysql but have not used sqlite so I wanted to try it. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

I am using an sqlite3 with python as the main code from a previously started database that I created.

I have a movies table with an ID, name, rating, stars for the movie table that you can create, read, update, delete from that table. 

# Development Environment

I used the commandline for sqlite3 to create the table then I used VS code and pyhon to be able to manipulate the table in to whatever you want the data to do. 

I was able to use the VS code as the main editor to make the data work with sqlite 3 using the python language.

# Future Work

- I would like to make it where you could sort or filter the database better
- have movie release date as well as the Genre of the movies
- I would like to make it so when it shows the movie with rating and stars not to have the parethisis around it as well as not to have the single quote to look more like 
Lilo and Stitch, Rating: G, Stars: 4
